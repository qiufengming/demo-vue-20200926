年为现期，2019 年为基期。要有时间轴概念，如果给 2019 年，求 2017、2012 年，向 2019 年左侧推就是基期；现期是未来的、没有发生的事情，给 2019年，求 2020 年，向 2019 年右侧推就是求现期。</p>\r\n                        <p>2.2020 年比 2019 年增长了 20 斤（增长量），增长的具体值就是增长量。增长量=现在-过去=现期- 基期=120-100=20 斤。</p>\r\n                        <p>3.2020 年比 2019 年增长 20%（增长率）。增长率（rate）就是增长的比例，用 r 表示，增长率=增长量/基期量=（现期量- 基期量）/基期量=（120-100）/100=20%。增长量和增长率问题下节课具体讲。</p>\r\n                        <p>4.有一种特殊表述：比如马云比我有钱，作为对比参照的是基期，“我”就是基期，“马云”就是现期；再比如我比马云帅，马云作为对比参照，所以“马云”就是基期，“我”就是现期。对比型题目总结：“比”字后面是基期，出现“A比 B……”，B 是基期，A

是一个部分，1/（1+a）是一个部分，（a-b）是一个部分。A/B 是现期比重，比重=部分（小数）/总体（大数），肯定小于 1。再看 1/（1+a），如果 a＞0，则 1/（1+a）＜1；如果 a＜0，则 1/（1+a）＞1；a 的取值不同，会有两种情况。我们做的是资料分析，根据我国的发展数据可知，比重 A/B 往往很小，最高达到 50%，所以 A/B＜1，如果 a＞0，A/B*[1/（1+a）]肯定＜1；在资料分析中，如果 a＜0，1/（1+a）也只会比 1 大一丢丢，综合起来，A/B*[1/（1+a）]还是比 1 小。</p>\r\n                                <p>（3）记住结论：A/B*[1/（1+a）]永远＜1，再乘以（a-b），所以 A/B*[1/（1+a）]*（a-b）＜|a-b|。</p>\r\n

100。肯定不是按照三个数字加和再除以 3 去求，而是看 101 比 100 多了 1，99 比 100 少了 1，把多的补给少的。利用互补思维求解平均数问题，就是削峰填谷。</p>\r\n                                <p>2.如果选项给了具体值，3234、3358、3446、3589

年的值为`基期*（1+r）=2016*（1+r_2）`，2018 年同比增长率为 `r_1`，`2018=2017*（1+r_1）=2016*（1+r_1）*（1+r_2）`，所以（2018 年-2016 年）/2016 年=[2016*（1+`r_1`）*（1+`r_2`）-2016]/2016=`1+r_1+r_2+r_1*r2-1`=`r_1+r_2+r_1*r_2`。</p>\r\n

<p>答：年均增长率和年均增长量的意思相似，都是每年的平均值。区别是：年均增长量=总的增长量/年份差=（200-100）/3≈33.3；但年均增长率有所不同，不是用总的增长率除以年份差，指的是每年增长率都一样，2011 年为基期，收入为 100 亿元，2012 年增长 r，所以 2012 年=100*（1+r），到 2013 年又增长 r，2013 年=100*（1+r）*（1+r）=100*（1+r）²，2014 年=100*（1+r）*（1+r）*（1+r）=100*（1+r）³，所以基期*`(1+r)^³`=现期，其中 n 指的是年份差，通用公式就是`（1+r）^n`=现期/基期。</p>\r\n                                <p>3.年均增长类问题年份差的选择：</p>\r\n

<p>（1）混合后居中（整体增长率介于部分增长率之间）。可以理解为两杯盐水混合，一杯浓度是10%，另一杯浓度是20%，混合后浓度一定介于10%～20%之间。如果多个量混合，浓度为5%、10%、28%的三杯盐水混合，混合后浓度介于5%～28%（最小值～最大值）之间。</p>\r\n                                <p>（2）偏向基期较大的（基期指的基期量，做题中一般用现期量近似代替，答案有误差，但基本可以忽略不计）。类似于拔河的思路，哪边人多哪边就有优势：浓度为10%的盐水一杯和浓度为20%的盐水一杯混合，混合后一定居中，浓度为15%。如果20%的盐水加200杯，10%的盐水加1杯，混合后结果一定接近20%。如果10%的盐水有1000杯，20%的盐水有1杯，混合后一定接近10%。如果将一颗糖丢进游泳池中，游泳池不会变甜，因为相比之下游泳池的水特别多；如果将一滴黑色墨水滴到大海中，大海也不会发生变化，因为一滴墨水对于大海来说微不足道，起不到改变效果。</p>\r\n

<p>A.7.2% &nbsp;&nbsp; B.8.7% &nbsp;&nbsp; C.10.4% &nbsp;&nbsp; D.13.1%</p>\r\n                                <p>答：问题时间2016年全年，材料中给出的是上半年和下半年。求GDP增速，材料中没有2016年全年的现期值、基期值和增长率，无法用公式直接求解。根据上半年+下半年=全年，是混合的概念，求增长率，为混合增长率问题。上半年增速为8%，下半年增速为12%，混合后一定介于8%～12%之间，排除A、D项。然后看谁的量大，少数服从多数，8%对应800亿，12%对应1200亿，如果量相同，混合后居中，中间值为10%，但实际是800＜1200，所以结果更偏向12%（量大的一边），结果介于10%～12%之间，对应C项。</p>\r\n

<p>（1）晨读资料是从《新华网》、《人民日报》等官方网站上收集的新闻热点，一般以热点评论文的形式呈现，例如针对改善民生，加强社会治理的现象，评论员写了一篇文章。每天早上粉笔的官方微博、圈子、班级群中都会发热点资料，统称为晨读资料。</p>\r\n            <p>（2）如何运用：</p>\r\n            <p>①晨读资料主要针对作文，小题主要从资料中找答案，只有作文会遇到材料之外的素材，例如举例论证一个观点，或者用名人名言来论证一个观点，这时需要用到材料之外的素材，如果都用材料内的素材，则不能体现“结合实际，不拘泥于‘给定资料’”。这些素材需要平时多读多看、养成习惯得来，看晨读资料就是提炼其中好的素材，这是最基础的。</p>\r\n            <p>②申论考的是大家对一些社会现象能否有逻辑地分析出来，分析不是凭空捏造的，而是根据资料进行分析，即申论考查大家是否能够将一篇资料有逻辑地分析、整理出来。晨读资料就是一篇很长的、有逻辑的资料，大家是否能将晨读资料有逻辑地分析出来，所以更高层次阅读晨读资料要划分出逻辑。例如资料一共有 5 段，段 1 引出话题，段 2 按照多个主体分析原因，接下来提出了一些对策，如果能像这样将资料按逻辑划分出来，这样大家的逻辑水平就得到了提升，利于大家理解申论材料。</p>\r\n            <p>（3）如果大家考上了公务员，简称“文山会海”，天天看文件、开会、帮领导写材料，这些都与文字打交道，那么怎么考查大家是否具备处理文字的能力。</p>\r\n            <p>①首先要能听懂领导的话，例如国家领导人去企业视察讲话，提到我们要尽快让中小企业复工，恢复生产，中间的规范词就是恢复生产、尽早复工、提升产生力，核心关键词就能体现大家是否听懂了，即对于文字材料能够听懂。</p>\r\n            <p>②然后还要“输出”，即能够写出文字资料、简洁清晰的答案、一篇作文、一篇公文，申论就是考查文字处理的能力，晨读资料那么长，大家能否读懂，并且加工出来，这些就是文字加工、处理的能力。</p>\r\n            <p>2.关于字迹：字好看会占便宜，主要体现在作文，例如两个人的作文都是 27 分的水平，但 A 的字迹非常大方、工整、漂亮，在此基础上会酌情加 3-5 分，这是锦上添花的效果，如果作文只考了 12 分，就算加 5 分，也还是三类问题，起不到效果。使用黑色的签字笔，或者钢笔，笔芯的粗细根据自己的喜好而定，建议用签字笔，因为钢笔的墨水容易弄黑试卷。</p>\r\n            <p>3.行书、楷书都可以，写草书会扣分。字丑没关系，只要工整、干净即可，阅卷人不会因为字丑扣分，只会因为字好看加 3 分左右。</p>\r\n            <p>4.写错字了轻轻划掉，接着写即可，如果在作文中写错了可以不改，不要用透明胶、涂改液、用口水擦。不改可能还看不到，一改就看到了。</p>\r\n            <p>5.是否需要用铅笔写一遍，再誊写：不需要用铅笔写一遍，再誊写，直接在题本上标注，例如标注“问题 1”“D1”，或者不同水彩笔标注，只要标注清楚，然后往答题纸上抄，题本上可以随意标注，但不能在答题纸上乱涂乱画，就算打草稿，也只是在题本上简要标注，没有时间让大家写一遍，再抄一遍。</p>\r\n            <p>6.申论提高不难，很多同学从 40 分提到了 80 分。</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n        <div

                 每怎么考，该题（2019 年河北）考到了轮流。（1）已知“甲、乙两队单独完成\r\n                                某项工程分别需要 10 天、17 天”，10 和 17 之间没有公约数，所以设工程总量为\r\n                                10*17=170；（2）算效率，P 甲=17，P

v-model=\"inputValue\" @keyup.delete=\"onKey\"/&gt; </p>\r\n                <p>系统修饰符：.ctrl、.alt、.shift、.meta</p>\r\n                <p>鼠标按钮修饰符：.left、.right、.middle（这些修饰符会限制处理函数仅响应特定的鼠标按钮。如：&lt;button
